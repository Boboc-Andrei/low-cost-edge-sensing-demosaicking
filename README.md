# low-cost-edge-sensing-demosaicking

Python implementation of low cost edge-sensing demosaicking algorithm (LED) based on "Low Cost Edge Sensing for High Quality Demosaicking" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8550686) by Y. Niu, J. Ouyang, W. Zuo and F. Wang. Initial implementation was done by the paper authors in Matlab.

I have rewritten the code in Python, so while I am not the creator of the algorithm, the Python implementation is my own work. Therefore, errors and suboptimalities can be attributed
to my own implementation, and not to the original authors.
